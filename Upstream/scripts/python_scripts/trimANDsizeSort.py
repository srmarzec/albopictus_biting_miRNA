# the number of sequences in the new, size-sorted file will print on the command line

# Run the program on the command line with "...paa9$ python size_sort_fastq.py input_filename"

#!!! Output file should be "size_selected_fastq" check this.

## !!!! need to check Biopython usage, make sure it is installed (use Conda) also biopython.org!!!
## !!!! AND...check Nathan's Biopython slides, class #11.
